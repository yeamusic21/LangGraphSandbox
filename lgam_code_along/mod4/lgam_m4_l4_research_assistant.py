# # Research Assistant
# 
# ## Review
# 
# We've covered a few major LangGraph themes:
# 
# * Memory
# * Human-in-the-loop
# * Controllability
# 
# Now, we'll bring these ideas together to tackle one of AI's most popular applications: research automation. 
# 
# Research is often laborious work offloaded to analysts. AI has considerable potential to assist with this.
# 
# However, research demands customization: raw LLM outputs are often poorly suited for real-world decision-making workflows. 
# 
# Customized, AI-based [research and report generation](https://jxnl.co/writing/2024/06/05/predictions-for-the-future-of-rag/#reports-over-rag) workflows are a promising way to address this.
# 
# ## Goal
# 
# Our goal is to build a lightweight, multi-agent system around chat models that customizes the research process.
# 
# `Source Selection` 
# * Users can choose any set of input sources for their research.
#   
# `Planning` 
# * Users provide a topic, and the system generates a team of AI analysts, each focusing on one sub-topic.
# * `Human-in-the-loop` will be used to refine these sub-topics before research begins.
#   
# `LLM Utilization`
# * Each analyst will conduct in-depth interviews with an expert AI using the selected sources.
# * The interview will be a multi-turn conversation to extract detailed insights as shown in the [STORM](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/blob/main/examples/storm/storm.ipynb) paper.
# * These interviews will be captured in a using `sub-graphs` with their internal state. 
#    
# `Research Process`
# * Experts will gather information to answer analyst questions in `parallel`.
# * And all interviews will be conducted simultaneously through `map-reduce`.
# 
# `Output Format` 
# * The gathered insights from each interview will be synthesized into a final report.
# * We'll use customizable prompts for the report, allowing for a flexible output format.

1. Analyze the content of the source documents: 
- The name of each source document is at the start of the document, with the <Document tag.
        
2. Create a report structure using markdown formatting:
- Use ## for the section title
- Use ### for sub-section headers
        
3. Write the report following this structure:
a. Title (## header)
b. Summary (### header)
c. Sources (### header)

4. Make your title engaging based upon the focus area of the analyst:

5. For the summary section:
- Set up summary with general background / context related to the focus area of the analyst
- Emphasize what is novel, interesting, or surprising about insights gathered from the interview
- Create a numbered list of source documents, as you use them
- Do not mention the names of interviewers or experts
- Aim for approximately 400 words maximum
- Use numbered sources in your report (e.g., [1], [2]) based on information from source documents
        
6. In the Sources section:
- Include all sources used in your report
- Provide full links to relevant websites or specific document paths
- Separate each source by a newline. Use two spaces at the end of each line to create a newline in Markdown.
- It will look like:

### Sources
[1] Link or Document name
[2] Link or Document name
